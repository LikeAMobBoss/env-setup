<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>Day 1 Codeworks</p>
<ul>
    <li>Git</li>
   <p> From my experiences today in class, i have learned that Git is a way for people to problem solve code and make webpages.</p>

    <li>Node</li>
    <p>I haven't had alot of practice with node but it seems very useful.</p>

    <li>npm- node package manager</li>
<p> Using npm has opened my eyes in command prompt with all the different commands. </p>

    <li>http-server</li>
<p> Making a webpage was very exciting and being able to edit whenever i feel the need is very enjoyable.</p>

    <li>VScode</li>
<p>This coding is very similar to when i was in Khan Academy but much easier to understand.   </p>

    <li>setup souce directory</li>
<p> It was very nice to make a folder for all my class work. </p>
</ul>
